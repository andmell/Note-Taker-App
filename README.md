# Note-Taker-App

## Description
This application was designed to write, save, edit and delete notes, with a user-specified title and text body. Users can refer to their previously written notes, which are saved in a .json database. This application makes use of several back-end programs, such as Node.js, Express.Js, and UUID, to ensure data given by the user will be saved in the server, and can also be retrieved upon page load. This application is deployed on Heroku, to provide both front-end and back-end functionality.

## Installation
No installation is necessary for this project, as its main functionality can be accessed by navigating to it's deployed Heroku webpage listed [Here](https://infinite-coast-35685-4c182fb8e923.herokuapp.com/). Once you arrive at the homepage, click on the center button titled "Get Started" to navigate to the notes page.

## Usage

You will arrive to a page that will prompt you to enter a title and some body text for a new note. After successfully writing a note, click the save button at the upper-right hand side of the screen to save the note to our database. Saved notes can be revisted, edited, and deleted. Their data will persist upon page reload.
